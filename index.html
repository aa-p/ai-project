    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>AI Project</strong> helps users understand Pinterest trends and
      content performance in a transparent way. We focus on providing analytics
      and insights by <strong>only using “GET” requests</strong> (read-only
      data retrieval) from the Pinterest API.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to help creators and businesses discover top-performing topics
      and better plan their content strategy. However, <em>we do not</em>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write or modify user content on Pinterest (no publishing, editing, or deleting Pins).</li>
      <li>Store personal user data without explicit consent.</li>
      <li>Perform automated actions like saving, following, commenting, or sending messages.</li>
      <li>Scrape or extract data in any way that violates Pinterest’s terms or community guidelines.</li>
      <li>Sell or share Pinterest user data with third parties.</li>
      <li>Offer competitor research or benchmarking without explicit Pinterest authorization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acceptable Use & Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      Our read-only integration aligns with 
      <a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/developer-guidelines" target="_blank">
      Pinterest’s Developer Guidelines</a> by focusing on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Content Marketing & Measurement Tools:</strong> We analyze publicly available
        Pins to provide trend insights and performance metrics, strictly via GET endpoints.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creative Tools:</strong> We may offer AI-driven suggestions to creators based on
        popular content, but do <em>not</em> automatically create or schedule Pins.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertiser & Audience Insights (Within Policy):</strong> We respect user privacy
        and do not store or combine Pinterest data with external data for targeting or monetization.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <em>not</em> perform any user actions on Pinterest. The application only sends 
      <strong>read-only (GET) requests</strong> to retrieve data, ensuring end users remain in 
      full control of their Pinterest accounts and actions.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Privacy & Data Handling</h2>
    <p>
      We handle any Pinterest data in strict compliance with our 
      <a href="privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. If you grant
      our AI Project limited access to your Pinterest data via OAuth, we only use
      that temporary token for <strong>retrieving (GET) relevant information</strong>
      that you have authorized. We never write, delete, or alter Pinterest content
      on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our project is <strong>not intended</strong> for children under 13. If you have 
      questions about our data practices, please see our 
      <a href="privacy-policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to discover trends on
      Pinterest using responsible, policy-compliant methods. By focusing on
      <strong>read-only analytics</strong>, we empower users with data-driven
      insights without ever automating or performing any unauthorized actions
      on their accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can rely on our analysis to shape their content strategy, while
      remaining confident that their Pinterest experience is fully within
      their control and compliant with Pinterest guidelines.
