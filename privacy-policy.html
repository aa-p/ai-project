  <h1>Privacy Policy for Trend Tracker</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 31, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Trend Tracker</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, 
    use, and share information when you use our website or services (collectively, the “Service”). Our Service 
    involves analyzing publicly available Pinterest content (“Pins”) to predict or illustrate trending topics 
    and insights.
  </p>
  <p>
    By using Trend Tracker, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy 
    Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our Service.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Pinterest OAuth Data</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to connect your Pinterest account, we may receive basic account data and an access token 
    via Pinterest’s OAuth process. This data may include your public profile information and any additional 
    information you explicitly authorize us to access.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not store or permanently save any data from your Pinterest account (apart from temporary tokens 
    necessary for making API requests to deliver our Service). We only retrieve data from Pinterest as needed 
    in real time.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Data</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Log Data:</strong> Our hosting environment (e.g., GitHub Pages) may automatically collect 
    information such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and timestamps. We use this 
    information only for basic analytics and to ensure the Service is functioning correctly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cookies:</strong> We do not directly set cookies on this site for user tracking. However, 
    third-party services (like Pinterest, iframes, or embedded content) may use cookies. Please review their 
    respective privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h3>1.3 User Communications</h3>
  <p>
    If you contact us (for example, via email or a contact form), we may keep a record of that communication 
    and any personal information you provide, solely for responding to your inquiry.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Service Provision:</strong> We use OAuth tokens and any requested data from Pinterest only to 
      provide the core functionality of Trend Tracker—namely, analyzing or displaying Pins to show trends or insights.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Trend Predictions:</strong> Our Service processes public Pins to predict or detect trends. We credit 
      all Pins to their rightful owners on Pinterest; we do not claim ownership of any of the content pulled from 
      Pinterest.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Compliance with Pinterest Policies:</strong> We follow Pinterest’s Developer Guidelines and do not 
      store, share, or sell personally identifiable information obtained through the Pinterest API.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Site Improvements:</strong> We may analyze aggregated usage data (e.g., how many people visit 
      a certain page) to improve our Service.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Third Parties</h3>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal data with third parties, except as necessary to 
    run the Service (e.g., facilitating communication with Pinterest through its API). We do not provide or 
    sell any information from our API calls to advertisers or other entities outside of Pinterest’s authorized 
    usage.
  </p>
  <h3>3.2 Legal Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>4. Credit and Intellectual Property</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Pinterest Content:</strong> All Pins, images, and trademarks remain the property of their respective 
      owners. We do not claim any ownership over Pinterest’s intellectual property or the Pins we analyze. We 
      merely display or analyze publicly accessible information to provide insights and trending data.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Attribution:</strong> Where feasible, we link Pins back to their original source on Pinterest 
      (e.g., https://www.pinterest.com/pin/...), and we do not alter or obscure Pinterest content, in compliance 
      with Pinterest’s policies.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>5. Data Retention & Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Retention:</strong> We only maintain temporary access tokens and do not permanently store 
      personal data from Pinterest in our databases. Any logs or analytical data are typically kept in aggregate 
      form for a limited period and then deleted or anonymized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Security Measures:</strong> We take reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access or 
      disclosure. However, no online service can fully eliminate security risks. Please use Trend Tracker at your own 
      discretion.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently 
    collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete 
    such information.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Access and Control:</strong> If you have authorized Trend Tracker to access your Pinterest account and 
    wish to revoke that permission, you can do so via your Pinterest account settings or by contacting us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Third-Party Links:</strong> Our Service may link to third-party sites (including Pinterest). We do 
    not control these sites, and this policy does not apply to them. Please review each third party’s privacy 
    practices.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the 
    top. We encourage you to review this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of Trend Tracker after 
    any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
